# Time Series Prediction with Wheat Prices
This is a short time series example with the Kaggle Dataset Cerial Prices Changes Within Last 30 Years.

## Our Goals and Analysis for this Data
So since we're only analyzing the wheat price per ton for that specific month and year, we wanted to see the trend for the price of wheat, compare the predictability of different time series models that we're going to create, and the pros and cons of each model. Specifically, our goals are:

* Analyze the pricing trend and determine any seasonal effects
* Use prior years' price to predict the price of wheat using a series of models (linear regression models, splines, and neural networks, etc) for one year- 2021.
* Analyze the pros anc cons of each model in predicting 2021 price data.
